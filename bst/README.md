# bath-bst: Harvard referencing style as recommended by the University of Bath Library

This package provides a [BibTeX] style to format reference lists in the
[Harvard style][bath-harvard] recommended by the University of Bath Library.
It should be used in conjunction with [natbib] for citations.

## Installation

### Automated way

A makefile is provided which you can use with the Make utility on
UNIX-like systems:

  * Running `make source` generates the derived files
      - README.md
      - bath.bst
      - bath-bst.bib
      - bath-bst.ins
  * Running `make` generates the above files and also bath-bst.pdf.
  * Running `make inst` installs the files in the user's TeX tree.
    You can undo this with `make uninst`.
  * Running `make install` installs the files in the local TeX tree.
    You can undo this with `make uninstall`.

### Manual way

You only need to follow the first two steps if you have made your own
changes to the .dtx file. The compiled files you need are included in
the zip archive.

 1. Run `tex bath-bst.dtx` to generate the source files.
 2. Compile bath-bst.dtx with [LuaLaTeX] and BibTeX to generate the
    documentation. You will need, among other things, the [luatexja],
    [adobemapping] and [ipaex] packages installed; this is just for the
    documentation, not for the BibTeX style itself.
 3. Move the files to your TeX tree as follows:
      - `source/bibtex/bath-bst`:
        bath-bst.dtx,
        (bath-bst.ins)
      - `bibtex/bst/bath-bst`:
        bath.bst
      - `doc/bibtex/bath-bst`:
        bath-bst.pdf,
        README.md

 4. You may then have to update your installation's file name database
    before TeX and friends can see the files.
